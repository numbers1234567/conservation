# Spherical Cows in a Vacuum

Anyone can simply spend about 30 seconds thinking about reciprocity to determine that momentum is conserved in a system when no external forces are acting on it. This naturally leads to the fact that the center of mass of such a system is in uniform motion. However, this is the boring way of going about things. In this short project, I want to demonstrate conservation of momentum the cool way!

## How to use

For each cow, you must first enter a mass and radius of the cow. Check the "Part of system?" prompt if you want this cow to be part of the center of mass calculation.

Then, click somewhere within the white border to place the cow.

Then, click elsewhere to define it's initial velocity.

Now, you have a single cow in the simulation! To add more, simply repeat the same process. Be careful of overlapping multiple cows, since this leads to them becoming stuck together forever.

When you're ready, simply press start and watch the chaos unfold!
